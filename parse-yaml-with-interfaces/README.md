# parse-yaml-with-interfaces

Sometimes you don't know the structure of a yaml file.
This example shows how you can read and write a yaml file, although the structure of the yaml file is unknown.
This is very flexible, but the extensive processing can sometimes be a bit complex.
If possible, you should always specify the structure (type struct) and only choose this approach if there really is no other way.
